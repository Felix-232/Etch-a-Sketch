# Etch-a-Sketch
## My version of the Etch-a-Sketch exercise from [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com).

This app lets you fill up to 10,000 squares individually with randomly generated colors.

- Use the **Change Size** button to set the canvas width and height (up to 100 squares per side).

- Use the **Reset Canvas** button to clear the canvas and start fresh.

When you hover over a square multiple times, it gradually gets darker, eventually *turning black* after 10 hovers.
